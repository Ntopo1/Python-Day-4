<h1> Python: 100 Days of Coding: Day 4</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Learn about Randomization and Lists. At the end of the day, I will make a Rock, Paper Scissors game using these new tools.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 1:</h3>
<p>Write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails":</p>

</p>
<p align="left"> This was a simple use of randomization in Python.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 2:</h3> 
<p>You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.</p> 
<br /> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> This was my program. However, I later learned about additional rules for the challenge. Here is another program that follows the rules:</p>

</p>
<p align="left"> Both programs produce the same results.</p> 
<br /> 
<br />
<h3>Task 3:</h3>
<p> You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.</p> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> This code required some outside research to understand the use of indexes.</p> 
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 4:</h3>
Create a rock, paper scissors game. </p>

</p>
<p align="left"> And here are the Results:</p>

<p align="left"> This was a fun exercise, a combination of logic and randomization. That's all for Day 4!</p>
